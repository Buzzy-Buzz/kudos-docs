# Archiving and Restoring

### Archiving vs Permanently Deleting

Archiving gives you the ability to remove a card or board from your screen. Both cards and boards that have been archived, can be restored.

Permanently deleting a board or a card will remove them completely from the system. They cannot be retrieved if you change your mind. Only use this option if you are sure you want to delete an item forever.

### How do I Archive a Card?

Click in to the card you want to archive. Use the `Archive` button at the bottom of the right-hand side to archive the card. The screen will show it has been archived and when you click away from it, it will disappear from the board.

Archived the card by mistake? If you're still in archived card screen, use the `Restore` button in the bottom right corner to bring the card back to the board.

### How do I Restore a Card or a List?

If you’ve moved away from the archiving window above, but need to restore a card, click the `Archived` button in the right-hand side menu. It will bring up a window where you can see your archived cards and lists. Click in to the main area of the card or list to bring it up, then click the `Restore` button to return it to the board.

### How do I permanently delete a card or list?

When you select Archive from the right-hand side menu, you’ll have the option to delete or restore. This can be seen in the above image, with buttons for Delete Mode and Restore Mode. You also have the bin icon for deleting.

Before deleting permanently, you’ll need to select which items you want to delete, and you’ll be prompted to confirm you want to delete them. Only complete this process if you are sure you’ll never need the list or card again. You can’t retrieve permanently deleted items.
