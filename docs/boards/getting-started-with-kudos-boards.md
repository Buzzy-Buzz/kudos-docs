# Getting Started with Kudos Boards

If you’re looking for a quick and easy guide to get up and running with Kudos Boards, look no further. On this page, you’ll find the basics to get started, including, navigating your My Boards dashboard, creating a board, adding cards, adding members, and more.  

---

### What is a Board?

A Board is a way of organising tasks, projects, or information. It allows you to invite your colleagues, friends or family to collaborate on it with you. Boards have multiple views: the traditional Kanban Board, Mind Map, and Timeline. Each of these views will transform the layout of the board and how the information is presented.

### How to Create a Board

From your My Boards page, use the `New Board +` in the main dashboard to get started.

In the pop-up window

* Add the name of the board

*	Description (optional) – write a note about the purpose of the board

*	Add people to your board (optional) - search people or teams in your organisation or invite external people by email (optional). You can also add members later from within your board.

*	Choose if you’d like your board visible only to you, or publicly to your organisation

* Then click `Next`.

All of these elements can be edited at any stage of your board, so if you forget something now or change your mind later, don't worry!

You’ll then be prompted to choose a template for your new board:

*	Select a tile to choose from inbuilt templates including Blank, Classic, Weekdays, Departments, Meeting

*	OR choose from an existing template by typing in the name – click Explore the Template Library to be taken to global templates. Find the template your looking for, then return to your original screen and type it in to select it

*	Select your starting view, Kanban for a board with lists and cards, Mind Map or Timeline.

* Then click `Create` to open your new board.

### Adding Lists and Cards

Depending on what template you’ve selected, some of your lists might already be created for you. Alternatively, start your board by clicking, `Add a List`. Commonly used lists names include ‘To Do’ ‘Doing’ ‘Done’, but you can be as creative as you like. This is a way of grouping your tasks and managing your workflow. The beauty of this design is that you can use lists and cards to mean anything you need to for the task at hand.

Under lists, you’ll add cards. These are the tasks that need to be completed, or information that will help you get your work done.

When you hit *Enter* on the keyboard, the card will automatically be added as a To Do, with a tick box next to it. Alternatively, you can click `Entry` to add it as an item without a tick box, or `Board`, to link the card to another board.

To add more information to a card, click on the card to edit it. All elements within the card can be edited, so add as much or as little information as you need.

### Adding Members to Your Board

Invite members to a board by clicking on `Members` in the right-hand menu. Search people or teams within your organisation or add external people by typing in their email address. Don’t forget to click `Add Members` before closing the window.

### Drag and Drop Cards, Colours, and Members

Move your cards between lists by dragging and dropping.

Use the same drag and drop concept to allocate colours and members to tasks from the right-hand side menu. You can also allocate these from within a card, using `Assign Users` and `Select Colours`. When you assign a user to a task, they'll be notified of the assignment via email and also via any news feeds that boards has access to (Teams, Workspace chat, Connections activity stream, etc.).
